2 different scripts are written. First script - kunal_deploy_elasticsearch.sh will install all necessay pkgs and then download the
docker-compose file from this repo.
Testing Script name - kunal_test_elasticsearch.sh should be executed after the first so you can check if the container is up and running.
Deploy Script will update system/install docker/pull docker-compose from github/start the container.

NOTE: This is purely elastic container and not the ELK or EFK stack.
